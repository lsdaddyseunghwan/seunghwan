# The word True in boolean numerically represented by 1
# The word False in boolean numerically represented by 0

print(bool1+5) #6

print(bool2 * b) # 0 because since the value of bool2 is False and False is represented
# by 0  0*any numner will give 0

text= "Text"
#since the boolean values are not represented by text value we cannot
# use +(addition) symbol between string and boolean
# therefore, following line will generate an error

print(bool1,text) # True Text

# we will only see numerical output with boolean
# only we use mathmatical operatrion with other
# numerical data types
